# Astra: Emotionally-Aware AI Assistant

Astra is a next-generation, emotionally-aware AI assistant built with OpenAI technologies (GPT-4o) and designed for real-time, evolving conversations.  
It supports **long-term memory**, **emotional recognition**, and **dynamic memory decay**, creating a deeply personalized user experience.

---

## Key Features

- **Emotional Awareness**: Detects emotions from natural language and adapts responses accordingly.
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers user facts, feelings, and events across sessions with intelligent decay.
- **Dynamic Forgetting**: Users can manually erase memories at any time.
- **Memory Compression**: Condenses redundant memories into smart summaries (coming soon).
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized to run seamlessly on iPad and solo developer environments.
- **API-Based Architecture**: Powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model with local SQLite3 database storage.
- **Self-Improving**: Regular upgrades planned for memory management, emotional nuance, and security.

## Project Vision

We envision Astra growing from a personal assistant into a **deeply human AI companion**:  
one that **learns**, **adapts**, **forgets** wisely, and **feels** alongside the user.

Future milestones include:

- Encrypted database storage (SQLCipher integration)
- Advanced multi-emotion detection (nostalgia, regret, hope)
- Background threading for real-time performance improvements
- User-configurable memory limits and memory maps
- Open grant funding and community collaborations
